# unreadable in any language

Some folk say treat their language of choice as a silver-bullet for readablilty.

I've spent a lot of my life trying to read understand and fix code that was
written under incentive systems that prioritised "just get something running"
over being understandable to other humans.

This repo shows that even code _readable_ languages like `python` can be rendered unreadable
when we don't actively value the comprehensibility of our output.

This repo contains a sample of `python` code written in a human-unfriendly style that I found when roaming GitHub. Some variable names have been changed to protect the innocent.

I find myself needing to refer to examples of real but hard-to-read code for teaching purposes... this fits that bill.

My aim is not to call out anyone for writing code that ends up like this: they were doing the best they
could in the circumstances at the time.

I do, however, want to use this as an example to help push for incentive systems
that _actively_ _promote_ _readability_ and think of code as a output/product whose quality we should care about.
